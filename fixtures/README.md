this folder is meant as a test for the cli version of `react-sfc`.


as a contributor, here's what you do

- stay at project root
- `./bin/cli.js watch -f fixtures/basic/react -t fixtures/basic/src`
- now you have a running react-sfc server
  - add files to `/fixtures/basic/react`
  - watch them get populated in `src`
