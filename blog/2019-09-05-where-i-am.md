# Blog: Where I Am Now

Where I am now with the SFC:

- i have a basic mvp: https://mobile.twitter.com/swyx/status/1124922333234368514
- no syntax highlighting
- styles are global
- no graphql

so i have a few different directions i can go in. I think it makes sense to go for scoped styles right now.
